# üè® FastHotel Scraper - Price Quotation API

This project is a web scraper for retrieving accommodation details from the **FastHotel** website. It allows you to search for available rooms based on your check-in and check-out dates, using **Puppeteer** to navigate and extract data directly from the reservation page.

---

## üöÄ How to Use

Send a **POST** request to the `/search` endpoint with your desired dates in the request body (JSON format).

---

## üìç Endpoint

**URL:**  
`http://localhost:8080/search`

**Method:**  
`POST`

---

## üì¶ Example Request Body

```json
{
    "checkin": "2024-08-25",
    "checkout": "2024-08-27"
}
```

# Test Dev Asksuite

Hey! Glad you're here.
I'm going to explain exactly what you'll have to implement in this test and what we expect as outcome.

First of all, we have this nice express.js boilerplate project to assist you so you don't have to create everything from scratch.

## Briefing
The traveller comes to our bot and asks for "Price quotation". Then the bot asks for the dates the traveller wants to 
stay at the bot's hotel.
At the moment the traveller fills the requested information the bot needs to search the prices for each room available in the check-in/check-out 
timeframe.

You will have to implement the API responsible for doing the searching part.
The necessary information for the crawler is under the [Assets](#assets) session

## What you'll need to do:
* Create a POST endpoint "/search"
    * The expected payload is:
    
        <pre>
        {
            "checkin": "YYYY-MM-DD", // Check-in date
            "checkout": "YYYY-MM-DD" // Check-out date
        }
        </pre>
        
       Example
       
        <pre>
        {
            "checkin": "2021-07-01", 
            "checkout": "2021-07-03"
        }
        </pre>
        
    * The expected result is an array of rooms:
    
        <pre>
        [{
            "name": string, // Room name
            "description": string,  // Room description
            "price": string, // Room daily price
            "image": string, // Room main photo
        }]
        </pre>
        
        Example
        
        <pre>
        [{
            "name": "STUDIO CASAL",
            "description": "Apartamentos localizados no pr√©dio principal do Resort, pr√≥ximos a recep√ß√£o e a √°rea de conviv√™ncia, com vista para √°rea de estacionamento n√£o possuem varanda. Acomoda at√© 1 adulto e 1 crian√ßa ou 2 adultos", 
            "price": "R$ 1.092,00",
            "image": "https://s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/fasthotel.cdn/quartosTipo/214-1-1632320429599483292-thumb.jpg"
        },
        {
            "name": "CABANA",
            "description": "Apartamentos espalhados pelos jardins do Resort, com vista jardim possuem varanda. Acomoda at√© 4 adultos ou 3 adultos e 1 crian√ßa ou 2 adultos e 2 crian√ßa ou 1 adulto e 3 crian√ßas, em duas camas casal.", 
            "price": "R$ 1.321,00",
            "image": "https://s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/fasthotel.cdn/quartosTipo/214-1-1632320429599483292-thumb.jpg"
        }]
        </pre>
        
To achieve this result you may:

* With puppeteer, go to the [https://reservations.fasthotel.me/188/214?entrada=2024-08-25&saida=2024-08-27&adultos=1#acomodacoes](#assets)
* Retrieve the needed information to assemble the payload using web crawling methods
